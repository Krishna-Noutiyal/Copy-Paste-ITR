Copy Paste ITR is an extension that enables copy, paste, and text selection functionality on the E-Filing portal of Income Tax Return (ITR) systems, where such actions are often restricted or disabled by default. The extension requires no additional configuration and is plug-and-play. Only works on `*.incometax.gov.in` websites; therefore, it does not interfere with other websites' copy and paste functionalities, such as Gmail, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc., when opened in the same browser.
